# Overview of Software Workflow
Here's a revised summary of the event-driven architecture and interaction flow for the wearable AI device with a camera:
The wearable AI device, designed as a hat with an integrated camera, employs an event-driven architecture to enable seamless and engaging user interactions. At the core of this system is an event loop that continuously monitors and processes incoming events from various sources, such as user voice commands, camera input, and network requests.
When the device detects the keyword "computer" through its always-on listening capability, it initiates an audio recording session. The recording continues until the keyword "reply" is detected, signaling the end of the user's input. If the keyword "snapshot" is heard during the recording, the device immediately captures an image using the integrated camera.
Once the recording is complete, the audio is sent to Assembly AI for transcription. The system then intelligently determines how to handle the transcribed text based on the context of ongoing conversations. It checks for the existence of a recently active conversation thread (within the last 90 seconds) and either creates a new thread or appends the transcription to the most recent thread accordingly.
With the transcription properly contextualized, the system initiates a streaming interaction with the AI assistant on the selected thread. The assistant processes the user's input, considering the conversation history and any relevant visual information from captured images.
As the AI assistant formulates its response, the system continuously processes and dispatches events related to the ongoing interaction. This includes handling text creation and modification events, as well as managing tool invocations like code interpretation or image analysis.
Finally, when the assistant's response is ready, the system sends the generated text to Eleven Labs' API for text-to-speech conversion. The resulting audio is then played back to the user through the device's speakers, completing the interactive loop and providing a seamless, hands-free experience.
Throughout this process, the event-driven architecture ensures that the wearable AI device remains responsive and adaptable to user input and external triggers. The modular design of event handlers allows for easy extension and customization of the device's capabilities, enabling the integration of new features and tools without disrupting the core functionality.

# Upon running your software, here's a step-by-step explanation of its operation, confirmed by the codebase:
#
# 1. **Initialization**:
#    - The software begins with the [initialize()](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#193%2C5-193%2C5) function in [main_controller.py](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#1%2C1-1%2C1), which sets up keyword detection and registers a message handler for detected words.
#    
# 2. **Main Loop**:
#    - Enters a continuous loop, simulating event reception and dispatching.
#    Certainly, let's delve deeper into how the loop continuation and event handling mechanism works in the provided context of main_controller.py.
#Core Loop Mechanism
#The core of the loop continuation mechanism is encapsulated within a while True loop. This is an infinite loop that keeps the application running indefinitely until it's manually stopped or an unhandled exception occurs. Here's a breakdown of its components:
#1. Infinite Loop: while True creates an endless loop, which is essential for continuously monitoring and responding to events in real-time applications.
#2. Simulated Event Reception: Inside the loop, there's a simulated event reception mechanism. In a real-world application, this part would be replaced by actual event reception, such as listening for user input, network requests, or sensor data. The simulation is represented by creating an event_received dictionary with predefined values.
#3. Event Dispatching: The dispatch_event function is called with the simulated event. This function acts as a central hub for event handling. It looks up the event type in the event_handlers dictionary to find the corresponding handler function and then calls that handler with the event data.
#4. Sleep: time.sleep(1) is used to pause the loop for 1 second. This is a simple way to prevent the loop from running too fast, which would be unnecessary for most applications and could lead to high CPU usage. In a real application, this might be replaced or complemented by event-driven waiting mechanisms.
#Event Handling
#The event handling mechanism is designed to be flexible and extensible:
#1. Event Handlers Dictionary: The event_handlers dictionary maps event types to their corresponding handler functions. This allows for easy addition or modification of event handling logic.
#2. Handler Functions: Each handler function is designed to process specific types of events. For example, on_thread_message_completed processes events where a message thread is completed. It extracts the message content, checks if the message has already been processed, and then uses the ElevenLabsManager to convert the text to speech.
#3. Processing and Playing Text: The ElevenLabsManager plays a crucial role in converting text messages into speech. This is part of the system's response mechanism, allowing for auditory feedback based on the event's context
# 3. **Keyword Detection**:
#    - Utilizes PocketSphinx for keyword detection, listening for specific keywords defined in `keywords.kws`.
#    
# 4. **Handling Detected Keywords**:
#    - Depending on the detected phrase, it may start/stop recording or activate picture mode. Additionally, if the command involves taking a snapshot, the software captures an image and sends it to an AI service for analysis and description asyncronously and stores the response somewhere so it can be retrieved later, like a dictopmaru pr global variable thinking,
#    
# 5. **Processing Recording**:
#    - If recording is stopped, it processes the recording by transcribing audio and optionally capturing and describing an image.
#    
# 6. **Interacting with Assistant**:
#    - Sends transcription or image description to the assistant, creating or using an existing thread for the interaction.
#     
# 7. **Handling Assistant's Response**: this is where the magic happens 
#    - The system works as follows:
#       1. It uses a dictionary named [event_handlers](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#164%2C1-164%2C1) to link different types of events to specific functions that know how to handle them.
#       2. When an event happens, the [dispatch_event](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#170%2C5-170%2C5) function looks up the event type in this dictionary to find the right function to handle it. If it finds one, it calls that function and passes along any relevant data.
#       3. For example, when a message is fully received (an event called `thread.message.completed`), the system calls the [on_thread_message_completed](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#145%2C5-145%2C5) function. This function takes the message content and uses the [ElevenLabsManager](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#159%2C19-159%2C19) to turn the text into speech and play it out loud.
#       4. The [ElevenLabsManager](file:///home/bord/heady/bouncerfork/Heady/main_controller.py#159%2C19-159%2C19) is responsible for converting the text messages into speech. It sends the text to the Eleven Labs API, which returns audio that the system can play.
#       - This setup allows the system to respond to different events with appropriate actions, such as playing back messages using speech synthesis.

# 8. **Event Simulation and Dispatch**:
#    - Simulated events in the main loop are dispatched to appropriate handlers, such as playing back messages for `thread.message.completed` events.
#    
# 9. **Loop Continuation**:
#    - The software continues to listen for keywords and simulate events, repeating the process.
#
# This sequence outlines the software's operation from initialization to handling interactions in a continuous loop.
# still no dice on heaving cloud make line at it so maybe that just doesn't work yet

 a robust event-driven architecture that enables seamless interaction between the user and the AI assistant. At the heart of this system lies an event loop that continuously monitors and processes incoming events. These events can originate from various sources, such as user input, network requests, or sensor data. The loop acts as a central hub, dispatching each event to its corresponding handler function based on the event type. This modular design allows for easy extensibility and maintainability, as new event types and handlers can be added without modifying the core loop logic.
Event Simulation and Dispatch
The main loop simulates receiving events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers based on the event type.
For thread.message.completed events, the corresponding handler processes the message by extracting the text content and using ElevenLabsManager to convert it to speech and play it back. This integration with the ElevenLabs API enables the system to provide an immersive audio experience, allowing the AI assistant to communicate with the user through natural-sounding speech.
Loop Continuation
The loop allows for continuous event processing, simulating real-time interaction. After handling an event, it sleeps briefly and then continues to the next iteration, ready to process the next event.
In a real scenario, events could come from various sources, such as user input (voice commands, text messages), network requests (API calls, web service interactions), or sensor data (IoT devices, environmental sensors). These real events would replace the simulated events in the loop.
By continuously processing events, the system can maintain an ongoing conversation and respond to user input or other triggers in near real-time. This responsive behavior creates an engaging and interactive user experience, making the AI assistant feel more like a natural conversation partner.
The combination of the event-driven architecture, modular event handlers, and the integration with the ElevenLabs API showcases a powerful and flexible system capable of handling diverse user interactions and providing a rich, multi-modal experience. As the system evolves, new event types and handlers can be easily incorporated, allowing for the addition of new features and capabilities without disrupting the core functionality.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the operation of the software based on the provided context, focusing on the interaction between the AssistantManager and MainController:
1. Initialization:
The software begins with the initialize() function in main_controller.py, which sets up keyword detection and registers a message handler for detected words.
2. Main Loop:
Enters a continuous loop, simulating event reception and dispatching.
In a real scenario, events would come from various sources like user input, network requests, or sensor data.
3. Keyword Detection:
Utilizes PocketSphinx for keyword detection, listening for specific keywords defined in keywords.kws.
4. Handling Detected Keywords:
Depending on the detected phrase, it may start/stop recording or activate picture mode. Additionally, if the command involves taking a snapshot, the software captures an image and sends it to an AI service for analysis and description asynchronously and stores the response somewhere so it can be retrieved later, like a dictionary or global variable.
5. Processing Recording:
If recording is stopped, it processes the recording by transcribing audio and optionally capturing and describing an image.
6. Interacting with Assistant:
Sends transcription or image description to the assistant, creating or using an existing thread for the interaction.
This is where the AssistantManager comes into play. It handles the interaction with the AI assistant, managing conversation threads and streaming responses.
7. Handling Assistant's Response:
The AssistantManager works as follows:
1. It uses a dictionary named event_handlers to link different types of events to specific functions that know how to handle them.
2. When an event happens, the dispatch_event function looks up the event type in this dictionary to find the right function to handle it. If it finds one, it calls that function and passes along any relevant data.
3. For example, when a message is fully received (an event called thread.message.completed), the system calls the on_thread_message_completed function. This function takes the message content and uses the ElevenLabsManager to turn the text into speech and play it out loud.
4. The ElevenLabsManager is responsible for converting the text messages into speech. It sends the text to the Eleven Labs API, which returns audio that the system can play.
This setup allows the system to respond to different events with appropriate actions, such as playing back messages using speech synthesis.
Event Simulation and Dispatch:
Simulated events in the main loop are dispatched to appropriate handlers, such as playing back messages for thread.message.completed events.
9. Loop Continuation:
The software continues to listen for keywords and simulate events, repeating the process.
In summary, the MainController handles the overall flow of the software, including keyword detection, recording, and event simulation. When it comes to interacting with the AI assistant, it relies on the AssistantManager to handle the conversation threads, stream responses, and dispatch events to the appropriate handlers. The AssistantManager, in turn, uses the ElevenLabsManager to convert the assistant's text responses into speech for playback to the user.

Based on the provided context, it seems the main loop in the software is continuously simulating event reception and dispatching. This loop acts as the central hub for handling interactions between the AssistantManager and MainController components. Here's a detailed breakdown of the input and output points and how they facilitate communication between these components for key logic state changes:
1. Keyword Detection (Input):
The MainController utilizes PocketSphinx to listen for specific keywords defined in keywords.kws.
When a keyword is detected, it triggers a state change in the MainController, such as starting/stopping recording or activating picture mode.
The detected keyword is an input to the MainController, which then determines the appropriate action to take.
2. Recording Processing (Output from MainController, Input to AssistantManager):
If the MainController stops recording based on the detected keyword, it processes the recording by transcribing the audio and optionally capturing and describing an image.
The transcription (and image description, if applicable) is then passed as input to the AssistantManager to initiate an interaction with the AI assistant.
3. Thread Management (Output from AssistantManager, Input to MainController):
The AssistantManager determines whether to create a new conversation thread or append the transcription to an existing thread based on the recency of the last interaction (within 90 seconds).
The decision to create a new thread or use an existing one is communicated back to the MainController, which keeps track of the active thread for the ongoing interaction.
4. Assistant Interaction (Output from AssistantManager, Input to MainController):
The AssistantManager initiates a streaming interaction with the AI assistant on the selected thread, passing the transcription (and image description) as input.
As the AI assistant generates a response, the AssistantManager continuously processes and dispatches events related to the ongoing interaction, such as text creation, modification, and tool invocations.
These events serve as output from the AssistantManager and input to the MainController, allowing it to handle the assistant's response accordingly.
5. Speech Synthesis (Output from MainController):
Once the AI assistant's response is complete, the MainController sends the generated text to the ElevenLabsManager for text-to-speech conversion.
The resulting audio is then played back to the user through the device's speakers, providing the assistant's response as auditory output.
6. Event Simulation and Dispatch (Internal to MainController):
The main loop in the MainController continuously simulates events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers based on the event type.
This mechanism allows the MainController to handle different types of events and trigger corresponding actions, such as playing back messages or invoking specific functions.
Throughout this process, the MainController and AssistantManager components communicate back and forth, exchanging inputs and outputs to facilitate a seamless interaction between the user and the AI assistant. The event-driven architecture and modular design enable the system to handle various scenarios and extend its functionality as needed.
