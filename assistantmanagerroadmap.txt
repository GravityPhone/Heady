how it worked when we started working on this (now? this will change as we develop towards our goal, so compare this to our current working code and changes list):

The assistant manager begins by importing necessary modules and classes, including openai, AssistantEventHandler, and time, to interact with the OpenAI API, handle events, and manage time-related functions respectively. It defines the AssistantManager class, initializing it with parameters for the OpenAI client, ElevenLabs manager, assistant ID, and optionally a thread ID. The constructor stores these parameters as instance variables for later use. The set_event_handler method allows setting a custom event handler for processing assistant responses. The create_thread method makes an API call to create a new conversation thread with the assistant and returns the thread ID. The handle_streaming_interaction method is the core function that sends the transcription to the assistant and manages the streaming of the assistant's response. It first checks if a thread ID exists; if not, it creates a new thread. It then sets up a streaming request to the OpenAI API with the transcription as input. The method listens for responses from the assistant, accumulating them until the response is complete. Once a complete response is received, it triggers the event handler to process the response, such as playing it back as speech. The CustomAssistantEventHandler class, inheriting from AssistantEventHandler, is defined to handle specific events during the assistant interaction. Its constructor initializes with an ElevenLabs manager instance and sets up an empty string to accumulate the complete response. The on_text_created method appends received text to the complete response string. The on_text_delta method processes incremental text updates from the assistant, printing them and appending to the complete response. The play_response method uses the ElevenLabs manager to convert the accumulated response text to speech and play it back, then resets the response for the next interaction. Lastly, the interact_with_assistant function is a utility to facilitate interaction with the assistant by creating an instance of AssistantManager, setting a custom event handler, and managing the conversation thread based on the transcription and timing.

what we need to do:

To align the AssistantManager class with the latest OpenAI API updates and the master plan for implementing function calling in your OpenAI streaming assistant, several modifications and enhancements are recommended. These changes aim to ensure that your assistant can dynamically call functions based on the assistant's requests, manage tool calls effectively, and integrate seamlessly with the rest of your program.
1. Update the AssistantManager Initialization
First, ensure that the AssistantManager is initialized with all necessary components, including the OpenAI client and any other modules it interacts with, such as ElevenLabsManager for text-to-speech conversion and a vision module for image-related tasks.
2. Implement Function Calling Mechanism
Implement a mechanism to handle function calls from the assistant. This involves parsing the assistant's requests to identify the function to be called and its arguments. You can achieve this by enhancing the EventHandler class to handle tool calls more effectively.
For example, update the on_tool_call_created method in your event handler to parse the tool call and execute the corresponding function:

class CustomAssistantEventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):
    ...
    def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call):
        # Example: Handle a "describe_image" tool call
        if tool_call.type == "describe_image":
            description = self.vision_module.describe_captured_image()
            self.send_description_to_assistant(description)


3. Streamline Event Handling
Ensure your event handler class (CustomAssistantEventHandler) can handle various events streamed from the assistant, such as text deltas, tool calls, and message completions. This is crucial for processing the assistant's responses and function call outputs in real-time.
4. Enhance Continuous Interaction
To support continuous interaction where the assistant can make multiple function calls in a sequence, encapsulate the interaction process in a loop within the AssistantManager. This loop should continue as long as there are tool calls being made or until a specific termination condition is met.
5. Error Handling and Debugging
Implement robust error handling for function calls and API interactions. This includes catching exceptions, validating tool call requests, and ensuring that your program can gracefully handle unexpected inputs or API errors.
6. Update Dependencies and Documentation
Ensure that your project dependencies are up-to-date with the latest OpenAI SDK versions. This is crucial for accessing the newest features and improvements. Additionally, update your project documentation to reflect these changes and provide clear instructions on how to interact with the updated assistant.
Conclusion
By following these guidelines and making the necessary updates to your AssistantManager and event handling logic, you'll enhance the functionality and reliability of your OpenAI streaming assistant. This will enable more dynamic interactions, improve error handling, and ensure your assistant remains compatible with the latest OpenAI API updates.
