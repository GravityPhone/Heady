Here's a detailed plan for implementing function calling in your OpenAI streaming assistant, written in a mix of English and pseudo-code:
1. Define the JSON schema for function calls:
function_name: The name of the function to be called (e.g., "send_to_zapier", "describe_image").
arguments: An object containing the necessary arguments for each function.
2. Update the CustomAssistantEventHandler:
In the on_tool_call_created method:
Parse the received JSON and extract the function_name and arguments.
Call the corresponding function based on the function_name:
If function_name is "send_to_zapier":
Extract the text argument from arguments.
Call send_to_zapier(text).
If function_name is "describe_image":
Call description = vision_module.describe_captured_image().
Call send_description_to_assistant(description).
3. Implement the functions:
send_to_zapier(text):
Establish a connection with Zapier.
Send the provided text to Zapier using the appropriate API or integration.
Handle any errors or exceptions.
vision_module.describe_captured_image():
Load the locally stored image captured during the snapshot.
Use the vision manager to analyze and describe the image.
Return the generated description.
send_description_to_assistant(description):
Format the description as expected by the assistant.
Use the appropriate method (e.g., on_tool_call_done) to send the description back to the assistant.
4. Test and debug:
Verify that the assistant is sending function calls with the correct function_name and arguments.
Test each function individually to ensure they execute as expected.
Debug any issues related to function execution, image description generation, or communication with the assistant.
5. Integrate with the existing codebase:
Ensure the function calling mechanism integrates seamlessly with the rest of your program.
Update any necessary configurations or dependencies.
Test the end-to-end flow, from receiving the function call to sending the result back to the assistant.
By following this plan, your program will be able to handle different function calls based on the JSON received from the OpenAI assistant. The assistant will specify the desired function and arguments, and your program will execute the corresponding function and send the result back to the assistant.
